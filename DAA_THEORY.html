                <h2>Course Learning Reflections</h2>
                <div class="inner-content">
                    <p><b>Types of Problems in Nature:</b><br>
                        Computational challenges mimic natural patterns, falling into iterative, recursive, and backtracking categories. Iteration solves problems by repeating steps until a goal is met. Recursion simplifies tasks by breaking them into smaller parts, as seen in Fibonacci calculations. Backtracking explores all possibilities, abandoning invalid paths, making it ideal for problems like N-Queens.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Importance of Space and Time Efficiency:</b><br>
                        Efficiency in algorithms revolves around minimizing time and memory usage. Time complexity reflects how execution scales with input size, while space complexity measures memory demand. Orders of growth, like constant \( O(1) \) or logarithmic \( O(\log n) \), help identify suitable algorithms. Striking a balance ensures optimal performance in real-world scenarios.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Lessons from Hash Tables:</b><br>
                        Hash tables exemplify efficiency, using well-designed hash functions to minimize collisions. Techniques like chaining and open addressing resolve conflicts effectively. These structures power practical applications like dictionaries and caches, blending simplicity with speed.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Tree Structures and Hierarchical Data:</b><br>
                        Trees efficiently represent hierarchy. Binary Search Trees (BSTs), AVL Trees, and Red-Black Trees maintain balance, ensuring operations like search and insert stay fast. Tries handle prefix-based queries, while Heaps prioritize elements, highlighting their wide-ranging applications in search engines and databases.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Optimizing Array Operations:</b><br>
                        Array query algorithms solve challenges like accessing and modifying data. Techniques such as prefix sums and binary search enable efficient range queries and data lookups, demonstrating arrays' versatility in structured data management.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Trees vs. Graphs:</b><br>
                        Trees and graphs, though similar, differ in purpose. Trees are hierarchical with a single root, while graphs allow cycles and multiple connections. Traversal techniques like DFS and BFS adapt graphs for complex applications like transportation and social networks.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Practical Sorting and Searching:</b><br>
                        Sorting and searching form the backbone of many applications. Merge Sort ensures stability, while Quick Sort balances speed and memory. Binary search offers swift lookups in sorted datasets, demonstrating these techniques' everyday relevance.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Graph Algorithms in Action:</b><br>
                        Graph algorithms tackle problems like shortest paths and spanning trees. Tools like Kruskal's and Dijkstra's algorithms optimize network design and navigation systems, bridging theoretical concepts with practical use.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Effective Algorithm Design:</b><br>
                        Key methodologies include:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Divide and Conquer:</b> Breaks problems into smaller subproblems, e.g., Merge Sort.</li>
                            <li><b>Dynamic Programming:</b> Addresses overlapping subproblems, optimizing solutions.</li>
                            <li><b>Greedy Approaches:</b> Focus on immediate gains, as in Huffman coding.</li>
                            <li><b>Backtracking:</b> Systematically explores possibilities, discarding invalid options.</li>
                        </ul>
                        These strategies solve diverse challenges by adapting to constraints.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Reflections on Problem-Solving:</b><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Efficient solutions balance speed and memory usage.</li>
                            <li>Simplicity often outweighs complexity for small-scale problems.</li>
                            <li>Recognizing patterns and constraints is key to algorithm selection.</li>
                            <li>Solutions must be adaptable to changing data or requirements.</li>
                            <li>Innovation and proven methods coexist, depending on the challenge's uniqueness.</li>
                        </ul>
